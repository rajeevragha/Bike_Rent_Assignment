# Linear Regression Bike Demand Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- This project is build to predict the demand of Bike rentals based on different features. In this we performed Linear Regression Analysis to predict the features that play a significant role in increasing the demand of the Bikes.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

- We are helping the business to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market using Linear Regression Analysis.
- Dataset: Bike Sharing details in different weather situtations, days, tempurature, Humidity, Windspeed, Casual or Registered users, year,seasons.

## Conclusions
- Company should promote new offers to raise the demand during Light_snowrain,Spring,Holiday and windspeed when it comes to normal stage Variables that Predict the demand:

The variables that helps to make significant predictions in demand are below

year
holiday
temp
windspeed
Month (September)
WeatherSit (Light_snowrain, Misty, spring)
Season (summer,winter)
